                <h1>Who is Carlos Ortiz?</h1>
                <p>Carlos Ortiz was born in Caguas, Puerto Rico in August of 1987. He lived in Puerto Rico until he was about eight 
                years old and then moved to Connecticut. His family ended up moving to Florida, where he grew up in Tallahassee. He has four siblings and practically raised his siblings growing up since his parents worked a lot. 
                Carlos lived in Tallahassee until he was twenty-five until he ventured out on his own and moved to Atlanta, Georgia for a job he had received. It was there that Carlos met his wife and they were married in
                 2016. They had a son in 2019 and a daughter in 2021. </p>
                 <p>Carlos has always been a gifted musician and began gigging when he was young. When he met his wife he realized that she was a musician as well and that brought them together. They traveled around Atlanta, Charlotte, and other neighboring cities playing music together. 
                    They try to incorporate music into their and their children’s lives on a daily basis by writing music about their life and experiences and playing music for their children. Both Carlos and his wife work full time jobs and continue to music on the side. </p>
                <p>This passion for music bred out of Carlos’s childhood. He would watch his uncle in Puerto Rico play music and instantly fell in love with rhythm. Ever since then, Carlos has been writing and producing music. He has performed many church retreats, produced many 
                    EPs and been involved in various musical communities. In his free time, some of his hobbies include spending time with his wife and kids, making quality coffee, writing and producing music. </p>
